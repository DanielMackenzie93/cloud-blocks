**Cloud Blocks** is an open-source collection of **AWS CDK constructs** designed to help teams build secure, reusable, and production-ready cloud infrastructure faster.

---

## Purpose

- Provide **reusable building blocks** for AWS CDK projects.
- Promote **best practices** in networking, observability, security, and more.
- Reduce boilerplate by delivering **ready-to-use constructs**.
- Empower teams to adopt CDK more quickly and consistently.

---

## Installation & Usage

Install the `@leighton-digital/cloud-blocks` npm package in the project:

```bash
npm install @leighton-digital/cloud-blocks
```

Use in your CDK app:

```ts
import * as cdk from "aws-cdk-lib";
import { ApiGatewayCloudFrontDistribution } from "@leighton-digital/cloud-blocks";

export class MyStack extends cdk.Stack {
  constructor(scope: cdk.App, id: string, props?: cdk.StackProps) {
    super(scope, id, props);

    new ApiGatewayCloudFrontDistribution(this, "ApiGwCdn", {
      domainName: "example.com"
    });
  }
}
```

> See each Constructs README for construct-specific props and examples.

---

## Getting Started (Developers)

Clone the repo and install dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/leighton-digital/cloud-blocks.git
cd cloud-blocks
npm install
```

### Common Commands

* **Build all packages**

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```
* **Run tests**

  ```bash
  npm test
  ```
* **Lint & format (Biome)**

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  npm run format:check
  ```
* **Type-check**

  ```bash
  npm run typecheck
  ```

* **Test CDK synthesis**

  ```bash
  cd tests/test-project
  pnpx cdk synth --all
  ```

> **Lefthook** runs local git hooks to format/lint staged files and run checks before push.

## Testing & Validation

### CDK Construct Validation

This project includes a comprehensive testing approach to ensure all CDK constructs work correctly:

**Test Project** (`tests/test-project/`)
- Contains a real CDK application that uses the constructs from this package
- Validates that constructs can be instantiated and synthesized without errors
- Serves as both a test and example implementation

**Automated Synthesis Testing**
- GitHub Actions automatically runs `cdk synth --all` on the test project
- Catches compilation errors, configuration issues, and CDK-specific problems
- Ensures constructs generate valid CloudFormation templates
- Runs on every pull request to prevent broken constructs from being merged

**Local Testing**
```bash
# Build the constructs
npm run build

# Test synthesis locally
cd tests/test-project
pnpx cdk synth --all
```

This approach ensures that:
- âœ… Constructs compile correctly
- âœ… CDK synthesis succeeds
- âœ… CloudFormation templates are generated properly
- âœ… Real-world usage patterns work as expected

## Release Process

Releases are automated via **GitHub Actions**:

1. Contributors create changesets with their PRs.
2. A **Release PR** is generated with version bumps and changelogs.
3. When merged, CI builds and **publishes** to the public npm registry.

Manual steps are documented in [PUBLISHING.md](https://github.com/leighton-digital/cloud-blocks/blob/main/PUBLISHING.md).
